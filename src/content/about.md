<h3 data-i18n="about.howItBeganTitle">How It Began</h3>
<p class="pg-st" data-i18n="about.howItBegan1">
  The True Christmas Project began with a simple idea: to bring the story of Christ’s birth back to the center of Christmas. 
  In a season often filled with noise and distraction, we aim to share a clear, joyful reminder of the gospel—through something 
  as small as a candy cane and as powerful as God’s Word.
</p>

<p class="pg-st" data-i18n="about.howItBegan2">
  Our project pairs a candy cane with a QR code that links to gospel-centered resources like essays, stories, and more. 
  This small act creates opportunities for conversation, connection, and reflection on the true reason we celebrate Christmas.
</p>

<p class="pg-st" data-i18n="about.howItBegan3">
  We’re not a business or a brand—we’re a growing community of believers with one purpose: to make Christ known. 
  Volunteers, individuals, and churches from all backgrounds come together to distribute candy canes, write essays, 
  translate materials, and share the message of hope with their communities.
</p>

<p class="pg-st" data-i18n="about.howItBegan4">
  Everything we offer—downloads, guides, and designs—is free to use for personal, church, or outreach purposes. 
  Whether you’re handing out candy canes at a local event, sharing them with your neighbors, or organizing a church outreach, 
  you’re part of something bigger: a collective effort to glorify Christ through simple acts of love and faith.
</p>

<p class="pg-st" data-i18n="about.howItBegan5">
  We know every story looks different, but our prayer is the same—for hearts to be drawn to Jesus, and for the true message of 
  Christmas to shine brightly in every home, every street, and every nation.

<p class="pg-st" data-i18n="mission">
  The True Christmas Project exists to proclaim the true meaning of Christ’s birth in a world that often silences it. 
  Through the simple yet powerful gift of a candy cane paired with a QR code linking to thoughtfully prepared resources, 
  we share the gospel, provide encouragement for believers, and connect local churches across denominational lines. 
  We equip volunteers, individuals, and communities to participate by distributing candy canes, contributing essays, 
  translating materials, or partnering with their churches, all to spread hope, joy, and the Good News of Jesus. 
  By offering accessible assets and guidance, we invite everyone to join in this unified effort, celebrating the true spirit of 
  Christmas and pointing hearts to Christ. We invite all to join, knowing that participation is voluntary and outcomes may vary, 
  yet our efforts are made to glorify Christ in every act.
