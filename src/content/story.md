<p class="title" data-i18n="story.title">The Candy Cane, the Cross, and the Savior</p>

<p class="pg-st">Have you ever wondered why candy canes appear almost like clockwork every Christmas season? They do not show up in spring, they do not fill the shelves in summer, and they are not the candy of choice in the fall. Yet once November arrives, these red-and-white hooks seem to be everywhere.</p>

<br>

<p class="pg-st">And while people debate exactly how the candy cane was invented, we know one thing for sure: the candy cane is not just a decoration or a sugary distraction. It is a tiny sermon eager to tell its story. For such a small and ordinary-looking object, it carries a loud message. Every stripe, every color, every curve points us to Jesus.</p>

<br>

<p class="pg-st">Imagine a red-and-white candy cane hanging on the tree. Now focus on the red stripes.
What do you think they represent? The red stripes remind us of the blood Jesus would one day shed on the Cross. Christmas celebrates His birth, but even in the manger there is an echo of His mission. The red reminds us that Jesus did not come just to be admired—He came to rescue. He came to stand in our place. He came to take the punishment for our sins.</p>

<br>

<p class="pg-st">Now look at the white stripes; what does white usually symbolize? Purity? Snow? Holiness? If so, you are exactly right. The white stripes point to Jesus’ perfect, pure, sinless life. He was fully God and fully man, yet without a single stain of sin. The white also declares what He does for us: He takes hearts that are scarlet with guilt and sin and washes them as white as snow (Isaiah 1:18). Jesus did not simply come to die for our sins and forgive us; he came to transform our hearts and mind from the inside out. He came to make us a new creation.</p>

<br>

<p class="pg-st">Now consider the shape hanging on your imaginary tree. See the curve at the top? What does it look like? A shepherd’s staff—simple, humble, and curved to rescue wandering sheep. This shape pulls our minds back to the shepherds in Luke 2, the first people to hear the angels proclaim the birth of Christ. God did not speak first to kings, scholars, or the rich—He chose simple shepherds watching their sheep in quiet fields.</p>

<br>

<p class="pg-st">The staff also reminds us that Jesus is our Good Shepherd. He knows His sheep—us—calls us by name, leads us, protects us, and even goes after us when we stray. Have you ever felt lost or unsure of where to go? Or needed someone to guide you—maybe a parent or a mentor? Hidden in this simple candy is a reminder that Jesus is our guide, our lamp, our protector who never abandons His flock.</p>

<br>

<p class="pg-st">Now turn the candy cane upside down. What do you see? A <i>J</i>? J for Jesus! It is simple—maybe even a little cheesy—but incredibly profound. The entire message of the candy cane hinges on His name. Everything about it points back to Him: His life, His death, His purity, His sacrifice, His shepherding care. In a world full of symbols that mean nothing, here is one that means <i>everything</i>.</p>

<br>

<p class="pg-st">If you put all this together, the candy cane becomes more than a treat. It becomes a symbol rich with truth to remind us each year.</p>

<br><br>

<p class="pg-st">Jesus came into the world with a purpose.</p><br>
<p class="pg-st">Jesus lived a life of perfect, Holy, sinless life.</p><br>
<p class="pg-st">Jesus shed his blood to save us.</p><br>
<p class="pg-st">Jesus leads and guards His people like a faithful Shepherd.</p><br>

<br>

<p class="pg-st">So next time you unwrap a candy cane, slow down for a moment. Consider what Jesus has done for you. With every sweet taste, remember that Jesus watches over His people and protects them. Let it remind you of an even sweeter truth—that the Savior who stepped into our world at Christmas two thousand years ago is the same Savior who still leads, still forgives, and still brings hope to all who believe. And if you are not a Christian, think about this. Think about what Jesus did for you. And consider how you will choose to respond.</p>
