<h3 data-i18n="about.howItBeganTitle">How It Began</h3>
<p class="pg-st" data-i18n="about.howItBegan1">
  The True Christmas Project began with a simple idea: to bring the story of Christ’s birth back to the center of Christmas. 
  In a season often filled with noise and distraction, we aim to share a clear, joyful reminder of the gospel—through something 
  as small as a candy cane and as powerful as God’s Word.
</p>

<p class="pg-st" data-i18n="about.howItBegan2">
  Our project pairs a candy cane with a QR code that links to gospel-centered resources like essays, stories, and more. 
  This small act creates opportunities for conversation, connection, and reflection on the true reason we celebrate Christmas.
</p>

<p class="pg-st" data-i18n="about.howItBegan3">
  We’re not a business or a brand—we’re a growing community of believers with one purpose: to make Christ known. 
  Volunteers, individuals, and churches from all backgrounds come together to distribute candy canes, write essays, 
  translate materials, and share the message of hope with their communities.
</p>

<p class="pg-st" data-i18n="about.howItBegan4">
  Everything we offer—downloads, guides, and designs—is free to use for personal, church, or outreach purposes. 
  Whether you’re handing out candy canes at a local event, sharing them with your neighbors, or organizing a church outreach, 
  you’re part of something bigger: a collective effort to glorify Christ through simple acts of love and faith.
</p>

  We know every story looks different, but our prayer is the same—for hearts to be drawn to Jesus, and for the true message of 
  Christmas to shine brightly in every home, every street, and every nation.

<h3 data-i18n="about.whyTitle">Why "The True Christmas Project"?</h3>
<p class="pg-st" data-i18n="about.whyDesc1">The name “The True Christmas Project” isn’t meant to suggest that it’s the only real or valid Christmas effort. Rather, it’s about pointing back to the true story of Christmas—the birth of Jesus Christ—amid a world that often buries that truth beneath commercialism and noise.</p>
<hr>
<p class="pg-st" data-i18n="about.whyDesc2">Our goal is simple: to help people remember the true meaning of Christmas and rediscover the message of hope, love, and redemption that began in a manger. This project exists not to compete with others, but to join the larger mission of believers everywhere who want to make Christ known during the Christmas season.</p>


<h3 data-i18n="about.missionTitle">Mission</h3>
<p class="pg-st" data-i18n="mission">
  The True Christmas Project exists to refocus hearts on the true meaning of Christmas: the birth of Christ, the promised Savior and Light who entered our dark world. In a culture that buries the gospel beneath noise, commercialism, and distraction, we aim to lift eyes back to the manger—back to Jesus, God with us. Through the simple gift of a candy cane paired with a QR code linking to biblically faithful resources, we proclaim the Good News, encourage believers, and connect individuals to local, Bible-believing, Bible-teaching churches. We equip volunteers and communities to take part through distribution, translation, writing, and church partnership, all so that Christ may be exalted and His gospel made known. Every act is done freely, joyfully, and for the glory of God alone, pointing all people to the hope found only in Jesus.
