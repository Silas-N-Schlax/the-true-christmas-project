        <h3 data-i18n="getInvolved.candy_cane_outreach.mission.title">Our Mission</h3>
        <p class="pg-st" data-i18n="mission">
          The True Christmas Project exists to refocus hearts on the true meaning of Christmas: the birth of Christ, the promised Savior and Light who entered our dark world. In a culture that buries the gospel beneath noise, commercialism, and distraction, we aim to lift eyes back to the manger—back to Jesus, God with us. Through the simple gift of a candy cane paired with a QR code linking to biblically faithful resources, we proclaim the Good News, encourage believers, and connect individuals to local, Bible-believing, Bible-teaching churches. We equip volunteers and communities to take part through distribution, translation, writing, and church partnership, all so that Christ may be exalted and His gospel made known. Every act is done freely, joyfully, and for the glory of God alone, pointing all people to the hope found only in Jesus.
        </p>

        <h3 data-i18n="getInvolved.candy_cane_outreach.participate.title">How to Participate</h3>
        <p class="pg-st" data-i18n="getInvolved.candy_cane_outreach.participate.text">
          Join us in sharing the true message of Christmas through the simple gift of a candy cane.
          This project is an easy and meaningful way to share the gospel with friends, neighbors, and anyone you meet during the Christmas season.
        </p>

        <h3 data-i18n="getInvolved.candy_cane_outreach.step1.title">Step 1 – Purchase Candy Canes</h3>
        <p class="pg-st" data-i18n="getInvolved.candy_cane_outreach.step1.text">
          Buy candy canes from any grocery store, dollar store, or online retailer. Choose individually wrapped ones so they stay clean and easy to hand out. We’ve found that Brach’s candy canes at Walmart are typically the most cost-effective option.
        </p>

        <h3 data-i18n="getInvolved.candy_cane_outreach.step2.title">Step 2 – Download and Print Resources</h3>
        <p class="pg-st" data-i18n="getInvolved.candy_cane_outreach.step2.text1">
          <a href="/get_involved/downloads"><b>Download</b></a>
          the printable cards made for this outreach. Each one explains the meaning behind the candy cane
          and includes a QR code that links back to this site where people can read more about the true meaning of Christmas.
        </p>
        <p class="pg-st" data-i18n="getInvolved.candy_cane_outreach.step2.text2">
          Print as many as you want, cut them out, and punch a small hole at the top and bottom so you can slide the candy cane through.
          <i>Instructions are in the PDF.</i>
        </p>

        <h3 data-i18n="getInvolved.candy_cane_outreach.step3.title">Step 3 – Assemble and Prepare</h3>
        <p class="pg-st" data-i18n="getInvolved.candy_cane_outreach.step3.text">
          Attach one card to each candy cane by sliding it through the holes.
          You can make these with your family, friends, or church group.
          Take time to pray over them and ask God to use these small gifts to open hearts to His truth.
        </p>

        <h3 data-i18n="getInvolved.candy_cane_outreach.step4.title">Step 4 – Share the Message</h3>
        <p class="pg-st" data-i18n="getInvolved.candy_cane_outreach.step4.text1">
          Hand them out in your community at work, school, church events, or Christmas parades.
          You can also give them out while volunteering, running errands, or at restaurants.
          Leave one with a kind note or prayer card at a drive-thru or on a neighbor’s doorstep.
          Every small act of kindness can point someone to Christ.
        </p>
        <p class="pg-st" data-i18n="getInvolved.candy_cane_outreach.step4.text2">
          If your workplace allows it, ask if you can leave a few out for customers to take.
          It is a simple way to share hope with anyone who walks in.
        </p>

        <h3 data-i18n="getInvolved.candy_cane_outreach.group.title">Optional Group Outreach</h3>
        <p class="pg-st" data-i18n="getInvolved.candy_cane_outreach.group.text">
          Invite your church, youth group, or Bible study to take part.
          Hosting a candy cane packing night or outreach walk is a fun and effective way to reach more people together.
        </p>
